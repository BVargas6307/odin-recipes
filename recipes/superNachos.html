      covered with melted cheese or cheese sauce, as well as a variety of other
      toppings, often including meats, vegetables, and condiments such as salsa
      or sour cream.

    <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Cook and stir ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until meat is
          crumbly and no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain excess grease. Stir
          in taco seasoning mix and water and simmer until beef mixture has
          thickened, 8 to 10 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the
          broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Spread tortilla chips on the prepared baking sheet; top with Cheddar
          cheese and dot with refried beans and ground beef mixture.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Broil in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, watching carefully
          to prevent burning, 3 to 5 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Top nachos with salsa, sour cream, black olives, green onions, and
          jalapeno peppers.
        </p>
