      NCarrot cake is cake that contains carrots mixed into the batter. Most
      modern carrot cake recipes have a white cream cheese frosting. Sometimes
      nuts such as walnuts or pecans are added into the cake batter, as well as
      spices such as cinnamon, ginger and ground mixed spice.

    <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Place flour in a bowl. Add salt, baking soda, and baking powder.
          Sprinkle in ground ginger and cinnamon. Whisk thoroughly until
          combined. Set aside.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Add sugar to a separate bowl. Whisk in eggs until mixture is smooth
          and pale yellow, 2 to 3 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Heat butter and coconut oil in a saucepan over low heat until just
          melted but not too hot. Whisk into the bowl with the eggs and sugar
          until well combined. Add carrots, crushed pineapple, pecans, and
          walnuts. Stir well.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Stir flour mixture into the carrot mixture until no dry spots remain.
          Pour batter into a greased 9x13-inch baking pan. Tap the pan against
          your counter to let any big air bubbles rise to the surface.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake
          comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool completely before
          frosting, at least 40 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Beat cream cheese, butter, and vanilla extract together using an
          electric mixer until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in the
          confectioners' sugar to form a smooth frosting. Spread evenly over the
          cooled cake. Chill completely before slicing.
